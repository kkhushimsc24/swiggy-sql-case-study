# Swiggy Case Study (SQL)

## Objective
To analyze customer behavior, restaurant performance, and revenue growth using SQL queries on a mock Swiggy dataset.

## Dataset
Three tables:
- `Customers(customer_id, name, city)`
- `Restaurants(restaurant_id, name, cuisine, city)`
- `Orders(order_id, customer_id, restaurant_id, order_date, amount)`

Sample data and a ready-to-use SQLite database are included:
- `swiggy_case_study.db`
- `customers.csv`, `restaurants.csv`, `orders.csv`

## How to Run
### Option A: SQLite CLI / DB Browser
1. Open `swiggy_case_study.db` in your SQLite tool.
2. Run queries from `queries.sql`.

### Option B: MySQL/PostgreSQL
1. Create the schema using `schema.sql`.
2. Import CSVs into respective tables.
3. Run queries from `queries.sql`.

## Key Queries
- Top 5 restaurants by revenue
- Top repeat customers (>2 orders)
- Monthly revenue growth
- Restaurant performance (AOV + total orders)

## Insights (example phrasing for README / interview)
- Identified high-revenue restaurants and months with strong growth.
- Detected customers with repeat ordering behavior to target with loyalty offers.
- Measured restaurant performance using AOV and total orders for ops/marketing decisions.
